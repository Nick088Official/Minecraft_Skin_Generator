[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1198701940511617164?color=%23738ADB&label=Discord&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/osai)

## Overview

The process of fine tuning a Stable Diffusion model to generate Minecraft character previews is detailed here: [Digging into Stable Diffusion-Generated Minecraft Skins](https://monadical.com/posts/mincraft-skin-generation.html).

This codebase further refines that model, and allows for in-game skins to be generated using only a text prompt.  The finetuned model for doing so is available on HuggingFace as [monadical-labs/minecraft-skin-generator](https://huggingface.co/monadical-labs/minecraft-skin-generator).  The model development process is described here in a subsequant blog post: [Even More Skin in the Game: Digging Deeper Into Stable Diffusion-Generated Minecraft Skins](https://monadical.com/posts/minecraft-skins-part2.html).

If you want to finetune this model, check [here](https://docs.monadical.com/zzthlWvuSj-PXyN4ZZiCyg#Fine-tuning-the-Stable-Diffusion-model)

## Example

Prompt: "A man in a purple suit wearing a tophat"

Output Image Asset Skin:

![images/purple.png](images/purple.png)

Skin Imported In Game:

# Requirements:
- [Python (3.10.6+)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [ImageMagick (ONLY IF YOU WANNA SEE THE GENERATED SKIN AS 3D MODEL)](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)

# Usage

## Local

### Precompiled

1. Click the Code button and download it as a Zip.

2. Extract the .zip file.

3. Now you gotta Inference:

4. Choose which version:

- Windows:

  - UI: Open Run_Inference_UI.bat, let it create the venv_ui and install the requirements. After that ctrl+click the local url.

  - NO UI: Open Run_Inference_NO_UI.bat, let it create the venv_no_ui and install the requirements, it will ask you for the parameters to set that are explained below

- Mac & Linux

  - UI: Open Run_Inference_UI.sh, let it create the venv_ui and install the requirements. After that ctrl+click the local url.

  - NO UI: Open Run_Inference_NO_UI.sh, let it create the venv_no_ui and install the requirements, it will ask you for the parameters to set that are explained below

A: Enter the prompt, so how the Minecraft Skins should look like.

B: Choose the Stable Diffusion Model, either 2 or xl (xl is better).

C: Enter the integer value for the Inference Steps, which is basically denoising the image so an higher value = better output but longer process, it's suggested to use either 25 or 50.

D: Enter the guidance scale, the float value for how much the output is adherent to the prompt, the 'max' is 10.0.

E: Enter the model precision type,fp16 (which is faster) or fp32 (which is more precise but slower and need more resources).

F: Put the Seed, the starting point to initiate the generation process, either an integer value or 0 for a random one, max is 2147483647.

G: Write the Output Image Skin Asset Name with the .png extension.

H: Choose if to see the output as a 3D model too or not, you need [ImageMagick (ONLY IF YOU WANNA SEE THE GENERATED SKIN AS 3D MODEL](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) for it (NO UI: y or n / UI: check the box).

I: Choose if to show a verbose (detailed) output or not, not really needed (NO UI: y or n / UI: check the box).

4. About the Outputs, if you are running:
   
- UI: Download output skin asset image by the download icon in the ui version in the web ui when its done making the skin, also you can download the 3d model in .glb format of the skin.
  
- NO UI: The output skin asset image will be saved into the output_minecraft_skins folder with the output name you gave it before, also you will have a (name-you-gave-the-skin)-converted.png which is the skin converted from 64x32 to 64x64 to make it adherent on the 3d model player which are in the files (this bug happened only to this 3d model, the skin asset will work fine in game, you can delete that file if you want to, it's useless and the 3d model will work without it), and also you will find a (name-you-gave-the-skin)_3d_model.glb
  
5. You can import now the skin into Minecraft, which you can do with a slightly different way based on the Minecraft version you play so just google it lol.

## Online

### Website
We have released a hosted version of our Minecraft Skin Generator at: [https://www.skingenerator.io](https://www.skingenerator.io)

While closed source, this version improves on the quality of generated skins from the publicly available model, plus it supports transparency in the helmet/hair section of the skins.  Please check it out and let us know what you think!
