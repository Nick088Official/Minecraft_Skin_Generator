[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1198701940511617164?color=%23738ADB&label=Discord&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/dnrgs5GHfG)

## Overview

The process of fine tuning a Stable Diffusion model to generate Minecraft character previews is detailed here: [Digging into Stable Diffusion-Generated Minecraft Skins](https://monadical.com/posts/mincraft-skin-generation.html).

This codebase further refines that model, and allows for in-game skins to be generated using only a text prompt.  The finetuned model for doing so is available on HuggingFace as [monadical-labs/minecraft-skin-generator](https://huggingface.co/monadical-labs/minecraft-skin-generator).  The model development process is described here in a subsequant blog post: [Even More Skin in the Game: Digging Deeper Into Stable Diffusion-Generated Minecraft Skins](https://monadical.com/posts/minecraft-skins-part2.html).

## Example

Prompt: "A man in a purple suit wearing a tophat"

Output Image Asset Skin:

![images/purple.png](images/purple.png)

Skin Imported In Game:

# Usage

## Local

### Precompiled

1. Click the Code button and download it as a Zip.

2. Extract the .zip file.

3: Now you gotta Inference:

A: Choose UI or NO UI:

- UI: Open Run_Inference_UI.bat, let it create the venv_ui and install the requirements. After that ctrl+click the local url.

- NO UI: Open Run_Inference_NO_UI.bat, let it create the venv_no_ui and install the requirements.

B: Enter the prompt, so how the Minecraft Skins should look like.

C: Choose the Stable Diffusion Model, either 2 or xl (which is better).

D: Enter the integer value for the Inference Steps, which is basically denoising the image so an higher value = better output but longer process.

E: Enter the guidance scale, the float value for how much the output is adherent to the prompt.

F: Enter the model precision type,fp16 (which is faster) or fp32 (which is more precise but slower and need more resources).

G: Put the Seed, the starting point to initiate the generation process, either an integer value or 0 for a random one.

H: Write the Output Image Skin Asset Name with the .png extension.

I: Choose if to show a verbose (detailed) output or not, not really needed (y or n).

4. If you are running NO UI The output skin will be saved into the output_minecraft_skins folder with the output name you gave it before, else just download it by the download icon in the ui version in the web ui when its done making the skin.
5. You can import now the skin into Minecraft, which is slightly different way based on the version you play so just google it lol.

## Online

### Website
We have released a hosted version of our Minecraft Skin Generator at: [https://www.skingenerator.io](https://www.skingenerator.io)

While closed source, this version improves on the quality of generated skins from the publicly available model, plus it supports transparency in the helmet/hair section of the skins.  Please check it out and let us know what you think!

### Hugging Face Space
You can use the [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Nick088/Stable_Diffusion_Finetuned_Minecraft_Skin_Generator), you can duplicate it by clicking the 3 dots in the right up corner and duplicate it on cpu to skip queue and also you can use your paid GPU to make it go faster
